    <h1>The World's Third Best Meatloaf</h1>
    <img src="../img/meatloaf.jpg" alt="A close-up, angled shot of a meatloaf served on a white rectangular plate. The meatloaf is a loaf shape, with a glossy, reddish-brown glaze on top, suggesting a tomato-based sauce.  Three thick slices have been cut and are arranged in front of the remaining portion of the loaf, showcasing the texture of the meat inside.  The meatloaf appears to be made with ground meat and visible flecks of vegetables.  Small sprigs of fresh parsley are scattered on top of the slices and around the plate as a garnish.  To the right of the plate is a knife with a wooden handle, lying diagonally across the surface.  The plate rests on a light gray, textured surface, possibly a stone countertop.  In the blurred background, a green and white patterned cloth is visible on the left, and a small white pot with a green plant is visible in the upper center.  The image is well-lit, highlighting the details of the meatloaf and its presentation." height="310">
