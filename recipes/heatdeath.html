    <h1>The Heat Death of the Universe</h1>
    <img src="../img/universe.jpg" alt="A digital illustration of a black hole against a dark, star-speckled background. The black hole is depicted as a central, perfect circle of pure blackness, representing the event horizon. Surrounding this central black circle is a bright, white ring, also perfectly circular, creating a stark contrast. This white ring is thicker at the top and bottom, giving the impression of a distorted halo or a ring seen at an angle. Extending outward from the white ring on either side are two large, curved bands of color. These bands are a gradient, transitioning from a warm, orange-brown at their edges to a lighter, almost white tone as they approach the white ring. The bands are angled, creating a sense of rotation or distortion around the central black hole. The entire image has a digital, slightly grainy quality, with small white dots scattered throughout the dark background, simulating stars. The illustration conveys the concept of a black hole's gravitational lensing and the bending of light around it." height="310">
