    <img src="../img/lasagna.jpg" alt="Overhead close-up of a serving of lasagna on a light blue plate with a thin rim. The lasagna has melted cheese on top and is served over a bright red tomato-based sauce. There are small pieces of red meat, possibly ham or bacon, and halved red cherry tomatoes. The plate is garnished with a sprig of fresh herbs and small yellow crumbs. The plate sits on a dark surface with a scattering of white powder, resembling flour." height="310">
