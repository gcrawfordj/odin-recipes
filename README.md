# odin-recipes

This repository contains my first project from The Odin Project curriculum: a simple recipe website.

## Project Description

The goal of this project was to demonstrate my understanding of basic HTML skills, including:

* Creating and structuring HTML documents.
* Using various HTML tags for text, images, and lists.
* Understanding and implementing relative and absolute links.
* Basic file organization within a project.

This website consists of a main index page with links to several recipe pages. Each recipe page provides details about a specific dish, including ingredients and instructions.

## Contents

* `index.html`: The main page of the recipe website.
* `recipes/`: A directory containing individual recipe HTML files.
    * `recipe1.html`: (Example recipe file)
    * `recipe2.html`: (Example recipe file)
    * `recipe3.html`: (Example recipe file)
    * ... (Other recipe files)
* `images/`: A directory containing images used in the recipes(Optional).

## How to View

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gcrawfordj/odin-recipes.git
    ```

2.  Navigate to the cloned directory:

3.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Future Improvements
